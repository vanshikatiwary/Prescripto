This project is a Doctor Appointment Booking System frontend, built with React.js and Tailwind CSS. It allows patients to book appointments with doctors based on their availability and specialty. The system displays only available time slots, making the booking process efficient and user-friendly.

The project includes a three-level authentication system:

Patient Login: Patients can log in to the website, book appointments with doctors, and manage their scheduled appointments.
Doctor Login: Doctors can log in to view their appointments and track earnings. They can also update their profiles from the dashboard.
Admin Dashboard: The admin has access to manage all appointments and doctor profiles, ensuring smooth operation and accurate records.
